This is a simple HTML-based college application form created as a test project during my internship.
It collects student personal and academic details in a structured format.
The form uses basic HTML elements like input fields, radio buttons, and dropdown menus.
This project helped me understand how real online admission forms are designed.
It demonstrates my basic front-end development and form creation skills.
